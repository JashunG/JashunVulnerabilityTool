# Security Vulnerability Scanner 

This project is a easy accessable security scanner designed to identify common vulnerabilities in web applications, such as XSS(Cross-Site Scripting),SQL Injection, and Directory Traversal. 
It uses Python and popular libraries such as `requests`, `json`, and `BeautifulSoup`. I hope this scanner aids in the early detection of vulnerabilities in web applications, helping to mitigate risks by simply requiring a URL as input.

# Features 

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection
- SQL Injection Detection
- Directory Traversal Detection
- Generates a JSON report of the scan results

# Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (`requests`, `bs4`)

# Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JashunG/security-vulnerability-scanner.git
